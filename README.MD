This repository serves as a platform for developers to collaboratively contribute unique coding questions and their solutions in various programming languages. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, this project enables you to explore diverse problem-solving approaches across different programming languages.

## Project Overview

- **Topic:** Any Code Any Lang
- **Description:** This project aims to encourage programmers to create and share coding questions along with their solutions in multiple programming languages.
- **Target Audience:** Anyone interested in learning, practicing, and comparing coding solutions across various programming languages.
- **Languages Supported:** C, C++, JavaScript, Java, Python, Dart, Kotlin, TypeScript, Mojo.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help us build a diverse collection of coding solutions. Follow these steps to contribute:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking the main repository using the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivinkv6/any-code-any-lang.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd any-code-any-lang
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution. The branch name should reflect the language, problem, and your username. For example:

```bash
git checkout -b username
```

### Step 4: Add Your Contribution

1. Within the repository, find the directory corresponding to the desired language (e.g., `c`, `python`, `java`).
2. Create a new file with a descriptive name that represents the problem you're contributing.
3. In the file, include your coding question as comments at the start of the code file. Clearly state the problem statement and any relevant details.
4. Provide a solution to the problem in the chosen programming language. Write organized and well-documented code.
5. Comment your code thoroughly, explaining each step of your solution. This helps others understand your thought process.

### Step 5: Commit and Push

After you've added your contribution, commit your changes and push them to your branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added [Language]: [Brief problem description]"
git push origin username
```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the [main repository](https://github.com/vivinkv6/any-code-any-lang).
2. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Click the "New Pull Request" button.
4. Set the base branch as `master` and the compare branch as `username`.
5. Write a clear and informative title and description for your pull request.
6. Click "Create Pull Request."

## Code Explanation

Ensure that your contributions include well-commented code that explains the problem-solving approach and the logic behind your solution. This enhances the learning experience for fellow contributors.
